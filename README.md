# Movie-Recommendation-System
Recommendation  system are 3 types
1.Content based recommedation system
It will recommend based on the similarity of content.
For eg: if you are watching a horro movie, more movies in that genre recommended
2.Colloborative filtering
Based on users similarity movies are recommended
For eg:If there are two persons watching same movie.Then Person who watch next movie will be recommended to other.
3.Hybrid 
The above two types are combined in hybrid recommendation system.

In this project we used content based recommendation system.
I used Cosine Similarity(vectorization)to create a Movie Recommender System!

These feature will save userâ€™s time which otherwise would have been wasted on finding a movie that he/she may or may not like.  Every month several movies are released, the movies database only gets bigger and bigger. This would help the system to provide a more accurate recommendation to the user and in turn increase customer satisfaction.
